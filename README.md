## Hello, I'm Kajeth (He/Him) ðŸ‘‹

**"Turning curiosity into code â€” weekly progress on data-driven, biology-inspired projects."**

I'm an undergraduate student in the Life Sciences with a strong interest in coding. Iâ€™m a self-taught programmer, and most of my projects are ongoing â€” built gradually during my spare time each week.

My primary language is Python, and I enjoy using it for data analysis with Pandas, as well as data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also have some experience with Java and HTML5, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning R for data analysis and C for lower-level programming.

I'm always looking to grow as a coder, so feedback on any of my projects is welcome and appreciated!
