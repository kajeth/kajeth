## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name name is Kajeth (He/Him). I am a undergraduate student in the Life Sciences but also self-taught coder.

My coding language is primarily Python, which I know how to analyze data (Pandas) & visualize it (Matplotlib & Seaborn).I know a bit about Java and HTML5. I hope to also learn R-analysis & C.

I hope to keep growing as a coder, so please feel free to give me feedback on my work. I would appreciate it!
