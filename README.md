ðŸŽ“ **Undergrad Life Sciences Student** | ðŸ’» **Self-Taught Coder** | ðŸŒ± **Always Learning**

Iâ€™m currently studying Life Sciences with a passion for neuroscience and data. In my spare time, I teach myself coding â€” mostly through personal projects, experiments, and explorations in biology and data science.

ðŸ§ª I use:
- **Python** for scripting, data analysis (`pandas`) and visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- A bit of **Java** and **HTML5**
- Planning to learn **R** (for stats + bio) and **C** (for deeper system-level understanding)

ðŸ”§ Most of my projects are **in progress**, built consistently over time.
I treat this space like a digital lab notebook: messy, active, and honest.

ðŸ“« **Feedback is welcome!**  
I appreciate any feedback on my work (positive, negative, constructive). I'm here to grow, experiment, and build.
